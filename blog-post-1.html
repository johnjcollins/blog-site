              Climbing a mountain under your own steam is one of the most
              fulfilling and rewarding things you can experience on a bike. It’s
              possible to truly enjoy the essence and freedom of the high
              mountains without having to master the skills or take the risks of
              a climber or mountaineer. Whilst the beauty of the mountains is
              that they are accessible for all to enjoy on two wheels,
              <em
                >this can sometimes throw up a few unexpected hurdles if you’re
                not well prepared, quickly taking you out of your comfort zone
                and into survival mode</em
              >. Unfortunately I’ve had to learn the hard way, getting caught
              out as the clouds roll in above and the temperature plummets is by
              no means a fun way to end a ride, so if you’re new to cycling then
              I’m hoping that some of the following points will not only
              maximise your enjoyment but also your safety as you venture into
              the mountains.

            <h2 class="heading-secondary">Make Sure Your Gear Is Ready</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
              You don’t need to be a professional mechanic to ride in the
              mountains, but remember that a taxi ride if you get stuck may not
              be an option especially when you realise your phone has no signal.
              Why does that always happen just when you need it most? A basic
              level of bike maintenance skills will go a long way.
              <strong
                >At an absolute minimum you should learn how to replace an inner
                tube should you puncture and, for new cyclists, how to remove
                and replace the rear wheel which at first can look like a Mensa
                IQ test with the chain and sprockets getting tangled if you’re
                not familiar with the process</strong
              >. Fixing a broken chain is also a very useful skill to have. I’ve
              helped many cyclists out in the past that have been flapping at
              the side of the road as the day slowly starts to disappear. Take
              the time to practice these basic skills in the comfort of your
              home and I’m absolutely sure you’ll be glad that you did should
              you ever have to bring them into play. If you’ve put a lot of
              miles in on your bike then consider having it serviced by your
              local bike shop or mechanic prior to heading to the mountains.
              Getting to the top of a col can be nerve wracking enough, you
              don’t want to be worrying about your bike as well.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading-secondary">Keep An Eye On The Sky</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
              If I had a penny for every minute I spent checking the forecast
              I’d be…..well, still doing this actually! The reality is that the
              weather plays the mother role in your pleasure or pain on the bike
              and this is hugely intensified when cycling at altitude. Whilst
              forecasts have got more precise over the years they should not be
              trusted fully.
              <span class="important">
                Weather can be very local in the mountains meaning it’s not
                uncommon to have favourable conditions in one area and biblical
                conditions just a few kilometres away</span
              >. This isn’t to put you off, it’s just to emphasise that you need
              to be aware of this and even if the forecast is giving you the
              thumbs up then proceed with some degree of caution. I’ve found
              it’s better to be like this than get caught out.

            <h2 class="heading-secondary">Know How To Get Down</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
              For many new road cyclists descending a long mountain pass for the
              first time can be quite a daunting experience. Often the challenge
              of making it to the top can overlook the fact that it’s a job in
              itself to get back down. The most important rule is to relax, if
              you’re too tense it’ll be much harder to handle your bike. Make
              sure you take on some fuel before you start the descent so that
              you can keep your concentration all the way down. Take your time
              and ride within your comfort zone, with time you’ll find your flow
              and become more confident. Respect other road users. The racing
              line suddenly becomes the death zone as an oncoming vehicle
              appears from nowhere if you’re caught on the wrong side of the
              road at speed. We’ll be taking a closer look at both climbing and
              descending techniques in future articles so stay tuned for more.

                I've loved bikes ever since I was a kid. But I hadn't ridden
                much during my college years and after graduation. Then a buddy
                of mine lost his driving license one summer for reasons I won't
                get into. He called me up and asked if I wanted to help him look
                for a bike so he could get around. We both bought a mountain
                bike ands spent the rest of the summer riding. I opened my own
                bike shop in Denver, CO soon after that. My friend drops by for
                a bike tune up every once in a while. After that, we head for
                the mountains.
